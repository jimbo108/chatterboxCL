Just changed code to send to all in self._conn_list EXCEPT the sender.
Currently the server is dropping all connections in the writable loop

SCREEN RETAINS INFORMATION ABOUT LAST addstr() what a headache

Got everything working with prompt_tryout, hashing seems to work
Working on the main_server, specifically pickling a Connection
object and sending it to the client.  It includes an attribute,
you_host_it, which tells the client whether or not they need to
open a new server for the seed (chatroom).  This is not implemented
on chat_client yet, and main_server is currently not functional and
incomplete.
